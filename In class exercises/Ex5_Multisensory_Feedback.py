# - You see the box and it seems like it will be light. Say $\mu_0=3.5\text{N}$.

# - When you lift the box, your perception is that it is actually heavier. It seems to be ùë•=6N

# - But, of course, your perception is noisy. ùúé_ùë•=1.0N

# - If your brain is doing optimal estimation, what is your new estimate of the weight of the box?

# %% id="meqamGDSgFp6"

# %% [markdown] id="J42cpXOYgGSQ"
# - You continue to lift the box 4 more times and perceive the weight to be: 6, 7, 7, 4, 5.
