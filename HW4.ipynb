    "Let us assume a participant is performing a visuomotor rotation task.\n",
    "There are $50$ baseline trials without rotation, then $50$ adaptation trials\n",
    "with a $30^{\\circ}$ rotation, followed by $8$ trials with a $-30$ degree\n",
    "counter-rotation, and finally  $30$ error clamp trials (with no feedback).\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. No forgetting\n",
    "Assume a single state model with only an adaptation rate ($B = 0.2$),\n",
    "with output noise $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}=8$ and state noise $\\sigma_{\\eta}=1.5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plot the adaptation and error curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. With forgetting\n",
    "Now include a retention rate ($A = 0.98$; $B = 0.1$). Use the same noises\n",
    "\n",
    "Plot the adaptation\n",
    "and error curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### c. Two state model\n",
    "Turn this into a two state model. Use the same state noise for both states\n",
    "and output noise as above.\n",
